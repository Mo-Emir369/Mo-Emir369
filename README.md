## Software Developer | Web • Backend • Mobile • Systems

I am a multi-disciplinary software developer with hands-on experience building real-world applications across web, backend, mobile, and systems programming.

I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and designing practical solutions that solve real problems.  
My approach is strongly project-driven, with continuous improvement through feedback and real usage.

## Core Strengths
- Designing and developing full-stack applications
- Building backend APIs and data-driven systems
- Developing mobile applications (Android & cross-platform)
- Working close to the system level when needed (C/C++, robotics)
- Strong problem-solving mindset and adaptability to new technologies
